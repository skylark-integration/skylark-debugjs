Add function end debug statement, this useful for recursion or for when
returning values from multiple function calls it's nice to see what function
the debugger is returning from, however, it's not straightforward because
function return statements ends the generator and if we need to implment that
we need to introduce a new instruction for return so we could go back to the
function and show the last step. Maybe this could be done in the debugger?

test component build works.

add general event dispatch.

Constructors (new expressions) are hacked in now and can't be stepped through
think of a better way.

don't wrap pure function event listeners
